    I get inspired by a lot of things, games and stories like Harvestella,
Wuthering Waves, or Metaphor ReFantazio have given me some ideas as of
late. But most of all, I think it’s the art that inspires me the most.
The illustrations and art direction in these stories are so beautiful and
fantastical. It’s amazing that anything can be drawn from nothing, and the
feeling of endless creativity drives me to draw as well.

Themes like melancholy, nostalgia and childhood experiences are ideas I
enjoy exploring the most. It could be things such as a walk with a friend after
school, or the clear blue sky you see during the summer. In my mind, the
normal and mundane can be so charming, and the memories we make in our
youth become precious. I don't want all my work to be so somber however,
since I like creating more fun and lighthearted animations/comics as well.
</p>

<p class="introtext yozaireg">
Despite digital art being my main medium, the artwork I want to create
comes from traditional techniques such as visible brush strokes, varying
texture, and even paint overs instead of the convenient eraser tool. I’m much
more drawn to artwork that feels loose and imperfect, yet still clearly
communicates its subject. What I strive to express from my art is a feeling.
Whether that be forming a smile or a more bittersweet expression, I want my
work to connect with others.
